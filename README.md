# TinySql CLI

TinySql CLI is a lightweight, terminal-based SQL-like database management system built with C# and .NET. It allows users to interact with a simple in-memory database using basic SQL commands and provides JSON-based persistent storage, making it an excellent project for learning database fundamentals and command-line application development.

## Features

- **Command-Line Interface:** Interact with TinySql using an intuitive terminal-based CLI.
- **SQL-like Commands:** Supports a subset of SQL commands:
  - `CREATE TABLE` â€“ Create a new table with a specified schema.
  - `INSERT INTO` â€“ Insert data into an existing table.
  - `SELECT * FROM` â€“ Retrieve and display all data from a table.
  - `EXIT` â€“ Exit the CLI.
- **Persistent Storage:** Uses JSON serialization to save the database state to disk, ensuring your data persists across sessions.
- **Modular Design:** Organized into Models, Services, and Storage components for easy maintenance and extension.
- **Cross-Platform:** Developed using .NET, making it runnable on any platform that supports the .NET runtime (including Ubuntu WSL).

## Project Structure

The TinySql project is structured in a modular way to ensure maintainability and scalability. Below is a breakdown of the project directories and files:

## ðŸ“‚ **Directory Breakdown**

### **1. Root Directory (`TinySql/`)**
- Contains the main entry point of the application (`Program.cs`).

### **2. `Program.cs`**
- The main entry point of the CLI application.
- Initializes the database and starts the command-line loop.
- Handles user input and executes SQL-like commands.

---

### **3. Models (`Models/`)**
This directory contains classes representing the core database structure.

- **`Database.cs`** â†’ Manages tables and provides methods for CRUD operations.
- **`Table.cs`** â†’ Represents an individual database table with columns and rows.
- **`Row.cs`** â†’ Defines the structure of a row in a table.
- **`Column.cs`** â†’ Defines the properties of a table column (e.g., name, data type).

---

### **4. Services (`Services/`)**
This directory contains services responsible for SQL parsing and command execution.

- **`QueryParser.cs`** â†’ Parses user-input SQL commands and converts them into executable actions.
  
#### ðŸ“‚ **Commands (`Commands/`)**
Contains command implementations for executing SQL-like statements.

- **`ICommand.cs`** â†’ Defines an interface for all SQL-like commands.
- **`CreateTableCommand.cs`** â†’ Implements the `CREATE TABLE` command.
- **`InsertCommand.cs`** â†’ Implements the `INSERT INTO` command.
- **`SelectCommand.cs`** â†’ Implements the `SELECT * FROM` command.

---

### **5. Storage (`Storage/`)**
This directory handles data persistence.

- **`FileStorage.cs`** â†’  Saves and loads the database from a JSON file (database.json) to ensure persistence across sessions.
